# eBox – Smart Storage Management App  

**eBox** is an innovative Android application that allows users to efficiently manage the contents of their storage boxes using QR codes. By integrating with a Firebase database, users can scan a QR code attached to a box and instantly view its contents on their smartphone—without physically opening the box.  

## Key Features  
✅ **QR Code Scanning** – Instantly retrieve information about a box and its contents.  
✅ **Firebase Database Integration** – Secure cloud storage for all box-related data.  
✅ **Box Content Preview** – Display a list of items stored inside a scanned box.  
✅ **Add & Edit Items** – Easily update the database by adding or removing items.  
✅ **Item Search** – Quickly find out which box contains a specific item.  
✅ **Real-Time Synchronization** – Instantly update and sync data across devices.  

## Who is eBox for?  
eBox is perfect for anyone who stores numerous items in boxes—whether at home, in offices, warehouses, or workshops. It helps eliminate clutter and saves time by allowing users to locate stored items without opening every box.  

## About the Project  
This app was my own project, developed as a final assignment for my study course. The project covered both backend and frontend development, utilizing technologies such as **Firebase** and **QR code scanning**.
